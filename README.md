- Two player game: "X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2
- Play background music by clicking "Music"
- Change background color by clicking Player 1 or Player 2 textfields
- Reset changes and score by clicking "Reset"

I followed android tutorial (thanks "Coding In Flow"!) and practised coding by adding small changes here and there.

TODO:
- add an option to play against the system
- revisit background service
