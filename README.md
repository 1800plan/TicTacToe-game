- Two player game: "X" for Player 1 and "O" for Player 2
- Play background music by clicking "Music"
- Change background color by clicking Player 1 or Player 2 textfields

I followed android tutorial from youtube (thanks "Coding In Flow"!) and practised coding by adding small changes.

TODO:
- add an option to play against the system
- revisit background service
